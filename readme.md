This project is a framework / sandbox for creating card games in html,css,js  
I try to strike a balance between low number of dependecies and ease of use  
I am a semi experienced software/game developper but a novice web developper. Feel free to make suggestion or feedback.

As of now , all arts are comming from the "[Humble Make Your Card Game Assets](https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036940693-Humble-Make-Your-Card-Game-Assets-EULA)" bundle
